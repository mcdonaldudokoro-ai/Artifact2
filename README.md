# Title  
AI and Machine Learning Timeline – A Visual Presentation of Key Milestones in the History of AI

# Introduction  
This artifact is a visual presentation that outlines the major phases of artificial intelligence and machine learning, from early theoretical foundations to modern large-scale generative models. 
It was designed to make the evolution of AI easy to understand for a broad audience, including students, beginners in the field, 
and professionals interested in how past breakthroughs shaped current innovations.

# Description  
The timeline highlights key milestones such as the Turing Test (1950), the coining of the term “Artificial Intelligence” (1956), the rise and fall of expert systems, the deep learning resurgence in the 2010s, 
and the recent acceleration of AI driven by cloud computing and large language models. 
Each era is summarized using clear visuals and simplified explanations to create an accessible learning resource rather than a dense historical report.

# Objective  
The objective of this project was to demonstrate my ability to communicate complex technical history in a format that is engaging, humourous and easy to follow, as well as useful for audiences who may not have formal AI backgrounds. 
It also served as an opportunity to practice visual storytelling,and topic simplification while preserving accuracy.

# Process  
1. Researched major AI milestones from 1950–2025
2. Translated complex events into simple, humorous explanations. 
3. Organized events into four eras: Birth of AI, AI Winters, Machine Learning Revival, Modern AI.  
4. Designed slides with minimal text, structured flow, and audience-friendly visuals. 
5. Edited as a group to balance humor with real educational content.  
6. Ensured the presentation could function both as a lecture aid and standalone educational resource.  
7. Practiced delivery for clarity, pacing, and audience engagement.
8. Delivered the presentation in class and validated that people were engaged 


# Tools and Technologies Used  
 Microsoft PowerPoint / Google Slides  
Collaborative editing (group workflow)  
Visual hierarchy and information design principles  
AI history  and research sourcing
Visual communication and information design


# Value Proposition  
This artifact demonstrates the ability to explain complex AI concepts in a way in a clear, digestible, and actually fun to pay attention to way - a skill that matters in real-world roles like training, onboarding, product education, and technical communication.

# Unique Value  
Unlike purely text-based summaries, this timeline was designed as a teaching-ready communication tool, me It shows skill in visual structuring, not just historical recall.
Most AI timelines are walls of text, jargon, and dates. While one uses humor, visuals, and narrative to make AI history human in a sense, not just historical.
It shows that I can teach technical topics without losing the audience — even when the audience is tired, overloaded, or new to the subject.

# Relevance  
1. Academic: Shows research ability and structured presentation design for simple communication. 

2. Professional: Demonstrates communication style suitable for demos, training, or internal stakeholder education. 

3. Personal Growth: Reinforced my understanding of how AI has evolved and helped clarify where my own career interests align within the field.
                 and motivates me more to take advantage of the current AI boom cycle. In addition it helped me practice the balance between accuracy and accessibility, which something need more everyday in Ai driven product roles
                 
4. Portfolio Alignment: Compliments technical artifacts by demonstrating presentation, teaching, and storytelling competency and compliments Artifact #1 by showing communication, not just engineering/AI application.
